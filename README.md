# Journey's End: Return of Nova Horizons
## The Story
In a historic mission, the world’s space agencies launched NOVA Horizon to study a mysterious object, but contact was lost near Jupiter, marking a tragic moment in space exploration. Two hundred thirteen years later, the object returns, still tethered to the ghostly NOVA Horizon. A new recovery mission discovers that the original crew had followed the object into interstellar space, uncovering groundbreaking cosmic secrets.

However, the ship's engines are too damaged to use safely. The recovery team must quickly download the invaluable data before abandoning NOVA Horizon, as overheating engines could destroy both the ship and its secrets. If they succeed, they could redefine humanity's understanding of the universe, but if they fail, the ship and its crew may remain lost in the cosmos for another 213 years.
